            My name is Yann "Liz3" HN and i have a big passion for League, in
            the game i am a passionated Xayah OTP playing in{" "}
            <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Shit elo</span>, as a Job and
            in my free time besides gaming & cars i code a LOT. My site:{" "}

          <h1>What is League Profile</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            League profile is my attempt to recreate the League Clients Profile
            page/matchlist and partial match page in React, the project came
            together in about 4 days and was nothing but a 4fun thing. But maybe
            now riot would hire me? never tried.
          </p>
          <h1>What is this build on/uses</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Only icons and some images are actually from riots LCU client,
            otherwise everything else is custom.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see its source here:{" "}
            <a href={"https://github.com/liz3/league-profile"} target="_blank">
              https://github.com/liz3/league-profile
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Data comes from Riots api everyone can use, the App itself is
            written in React with redux & styled-components.
          </p>
          <h1>How do i use it</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Yep enough talking here you go(press enter to go to the profile):
          </p>
          <Search />

          <h1>Please note:</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Do NOT use this on mobile as it will not look represantive and
            rather cursed. If you want this to look as close as the actual
            client use a 1080p res or 720p (ish) as the site has a breakpoint at
            1780px but a lot of image sizes are NOT responsive.
